# =============================================================================
# Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.
# 
# According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
# 
# Given binary search tree:  root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5]
# 
#         _______6______
#        /              \
#     ___2__          ___8__
#    /      \        /      \
#    0      _4       7       9
#          /  \
#          3   5
# Example 1:
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
# Output: 6
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
# Example 2:
# 
# Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
# Output: 2
# Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself 
#              according to the LCA definition.
